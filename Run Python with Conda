create a python test file:
touch test.py

activate your favorite conda environment:
conda activate my_env

you will see that the terminal line will start with:

(my_env)....

this means that the environment is correctly loaded

you can still use bash commands by the way and at the same time
use python inside the environment

run your script:
python test.py


to create an environment in conda:

conda create --name my_env python=3

use

conda deactivate my_env

to deactive the current environment
