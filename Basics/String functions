UPPER AND LOWER

We can use some functions to manipulate strings
'Paul'.upper() will give us:

'PAUL'

the same for .lower()

'hi'.lower() will convert the string to lowercase


REPLACE

'hello'.replace('e','s') #will replace the 'e'character with an 's' character

'hssllo'

you can also add the number of occurrences

'hello my name is Elmer'.replace('e','s', 2)

you will get:
'hsllo my nams is Elmer'

seen that the '2' indicates that only the first 2 occurrences will be replaced


SPLIT

to use the whitespace as delimiter:

'This is a string'.split()

you will get :

['This', 'is', 'a', 'string']

you can use any delimiter you like or need

STRIP

will remove the leading and trailing characters

' This is a string '.strip()
if a character is not provided whitespaces will be removed if present:

you will get in this case:

'This is a string'
