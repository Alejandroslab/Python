In Mac for legacy reasons python 2.x is installed alongside python 3.x

It is recommended to use python 3 for new code stuff as also syntax has changed

to manage this difference in the command line just run :

'python3' to run python

instead of 'python' 


To manage packages use also 'pip3' instead of 'pip'
